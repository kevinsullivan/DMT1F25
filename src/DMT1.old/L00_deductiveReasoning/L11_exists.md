# Class Notes on Exists

This file contains rough class notes on existential
quantification, particularly on elimination. The first
section is review emphasizing predicates. The comes
the material on Exists per se.



```lean
-- Prove transitivity of Equality, uses rw tactic
example {n m k : Nat} : (n = m) → (m = k) → (n = k) :=
fun hnm hmk => by
  rw [hnm]
  rw [hmk]

-- Again, uses intro tactic
example {n m k : Nat} : (n = m) → (m = k) → (n = k) :=
by
  intro hnm hmk
  rw [hnm, hmk]
```


As two more examples, we'll re-prove
the theorem that equality is transitive
using the rewrite right-to-left tactic,
*rw [← ]*, and then using rw to change
a variable in an assumption.



```lean
def eqTrans
                  -- context
  (α : Type)
  (P : α → Prop)
  (a b c : α)
  (ab : a = b)
  (bc : b = c)
  (hpa : P a) :
  -------------   -- turnstile
  P c :=          -- goal

  -- proof-constructing tactic script
by
  rw [← bc]   -- Eq.subst from b = c
  rw [← ab]
  trivial
  -- assumption
  -- exact hpa

def eqTrans'
                  -- context
  (α : Type)
  (P : α → Prop)
  (a b c : α)
  (ab : a = b)
  (bc : b = c)
  (hpa : P a) :
  -------------   -- turnstile
  P c :=          -- goal

  -- proof-constructing tactic script
  -- new tactic: assumption (proof in context)
by
  rw [ab] at hpa
  rw [bc] at hpa
  exact hpa
  -- assumption
  -- trivial
```

### Axioms and Theorems for Eq
```lean
-- Axioms for equality
#check Eq.refl
#check Eq.subst

-- Theorems for equality
#check Eq.symm
#check Eq.trans


example (α : Type) (a b c : α) (h₁ : a = b) (h₂ : b = c) : (c = a) :=
Eq.symm (Eq.trans h₁ h₂)     -- Use the Lean-given theorems (functions!) to finish this proof
```

### Predicates

A predicate is a function from objects of argument
types to propositions. We can define predicates as
ordinary functions that return propositions.

```lean
def IsEven (n : Nat) := n % 2 = 0
```

We can also define predicates as inductive types,
allowing us to define exactly what counts as a proof.
```lean
inductive IsEv : Nat → Prop where
-- the term ev0 is is defined to be a value/proof of (IsEv 0)
| ev0 : IsEv 0
-- applying evNPlus2 to any n and a proof n is even is a proof n+2 is even
| evNPlus2 (n : Nat) (h : IsEv n) :  IsEv (n + 2)
open IsEv

-- A proof that 6 is even is built from 4 and a proof that 4 is even
example : IsEv 6 :=
(
  evNPlus2
    _
    (
      evNPlus2
      _
      (
        evNPlus2
        _
        ev0       -- with the recursion ending at this basic term
      )
    )
)

-- Exists.intro: prove ∃ x, P x with a pair: a specific x  and a proof of P x
example : ∃ (n : Nat), IsEv n := Exists.intro 0 ev0 -- you finish it

-- Elimination is interesting
#check Exists.elim

/-
```lean

Exists.elim.{u}

  {α : Sort u}
  {p : α → Prop}
  {b : Prop}
  (h₁ : ∃ x, p x)
  (h₂ : ∀ (a : α), p a → b) :
  --------------------------- ∃_elim
  b

Exists.elim :
  ∀ {α : Sort u}
  {p : α → Prop}
  {b : Prop}
  (h₁ : ∃ x, p x)
  ------------------------- ∃_elim h₁
  (∀ (a : α), p a → b) → b

```

In plain English: Suppose you have a proof that
something, x, that has some property, P, exists.
That is, (∃ x, P x). Suppose furthermore that you
have a proof that if *any* object, *a*, satisfies
P, then some other proposition, *b*, must be valid.
Then you can validly deduce that *b is valid*.
*valid*.

```

YOUR JOB: Replace the sorry. Take this as an opportunity
to study the proof state. (Replace sorry with _ and use
your InfoView to see the current tactic state. Your goal
is not to guess until something works; it's to genuinely
see the logic. Here's the proof state at the sorry.

```lean
h : ∃ x y, x + y = 10
wx : Nat
pfwx : (fun x => ∃ y, x + y = 10) wx
wy : Nat
pfwy : (fun y => wx + y = 10) wy
⊢ wx + wy = 10
```

The one new concept to apply here is that
predicates are parameterized propositions:
propositions with placeholders. You apply
a predicate to an object to substitute that
object in for the placeholder.

In Lean, we know a predicate is represented
by a function from an argument type to Prop.
Now you will understand pfwx and pfwy. Each
is a proof of a proposition obtained by the
*application* of a *predicate* (function)
to an *argument* value (wx, wy).

These function (predicate) applications yield
the propositions obtained by substituting the
*actual* parameters (wx, wy) for the *formal*
(x, y) in the function *bodies* (after the =>).

We have the following assumptions to work with:
- proof (h) that there are two natural numbers that add to 10
- a natural number, wx
- proof, pfxy: for that wx there is a y so wx + y = 10
- a natural number, wy
- proof, pfwy that for that wx, wy "is such that" wx + wy = 10

In this context, the remaining goal is to prove wx + wy = 10
Of course that's easy to do mechanically. Now you know why!

HOMEWORK.
